I'll walk you through EVERY single step! Just follow along! 😊


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 📋 BEFORE WE START - YOU NEED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[ ] GitHub account (Sign up at github.com if you don't have one)
[ ] Git installed (We'll check this in Step 1)
[ ] Internet connection


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 1: CHECK IF GIT IS INSTALLED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Press Windows key + R
2. Type: cmd
3. Press Enter
4. Type: git --version
5. Press Enter

✅ If you see "git version X.X.X" → Git is installed! Go to Step 2.

❌ If you see "git is not recognized" → You need to install Git:
   → Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
   → Run the installer (keep all default settings)
   → Restart your computer
   → Come back and check again


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 2: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Open browser → Go to: https://github.com/new

2. Fill in:
   Repository name: VisionSpeak-Project
   Description: AI-Powered Smart Glasses Platform
   Visibility: ✓ Public (select this)
   
3. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: DON'T check these boxes:
   ☐ Add a README file
   ☐ Add .gitignore
   ☐ Choose a license
   
4. Click the green "Create repository" button

5. You'll see a page with commands - LEAVE IT OPEN! We'll use it.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 3: RUN THE AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is the EASY part! I've created a script that does everything!

1. In your project folder, double-click: DEPLOY_TO_GITHUB.bat

2. When asked "Enter your GitHub username:", type your username
   Example: If your GitHub is github.com/john123, type: john123

3. Press Enter

4. You'll be asked for credentials:
   Username: (type your GitHub username again)
   Password: ⚠️ DON'T use your GitHub password!
   
   Instead, use a PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN:
   
   HOW TO GET TOKEN:
   a. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   b. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   c. Note: VisionSpeak Deploy
   d. Expiration: 90 days (or your choice)
   e. Select scopes: ✓ repo (check this box)
   f. Scroll down → Click "Generate token"
   g. COPY the token (it looks like: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx)
   h. Paste it when asked for password
   
   ⚠️ You won't see the token as you paste - that's normal!

5. Press Enter

6. Wait for "SUCCESS! Code pushed to GitHub!" message


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 4: ENABLE GITHUB PAGES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Now make your website live!

1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VisionSpeak-Project
   (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username)

2. Click the "Settings" tab (top right, gear icon)

3. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click "Pages"

4. Under "Branch":
   - Click the dropdown that says "None"
   - Select "main"
   - Keep "/ (root)" selected
   - Click "Save"

5. You'll see: "Your site is ready to be published at..."

6. Wait 2-3 minutes (GitHub is building your site)

7. Refresh the page

8. You'll see: "Your site is live at https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/VisionSpeak-Project/"

9. Click that link!

10. 🎉 YOUR WEBSITE IS LIVE! 🎉


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 5: TEST YOUR LIVE WEBSITE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Visit: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/VisionSpeak-Project/

Test these:
✓ Page loads with VisionSpeak header
✓ Change language (dropdown or say "Telugu")
✓ Fonts change for Asian languages
✓ Voice commands work
✓ Watch demo video
✓ Add products to cart
✓ All images visible

 ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM: "git is not recognized"
SOLUTION: Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win

PROBLEM: "Authentication failed"
SOLUTION: Use Personal Access Token, not password

PROBLEM: "Repository not found"
SOLUTION: Make sure you created the repo at github.com/new first

SOLUTION: Make sure image files are in your project folder:
         - vision-lite.png
         - vision-pro.png
         - vision-max.png

PROBLEM: 404 error on GitHub Pages
